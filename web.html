        If you ask any child, who their favorite person is, they would tell you
        it is their mom. A very wise writer once described a mother's love this
        way: 'A mother's love for her child is like nothing else in the world.
        It knows no law, no pity. It dares all things and crushes down
        remorselessly all that stands in its path.'

        person I am today. Thank you for being an exceptional mother, an amazing
        friend, and someone I look up to every day of my life. Happy birthday!"
        "I'm glad that with each year that passes I get to celebrate another
        year with you.
